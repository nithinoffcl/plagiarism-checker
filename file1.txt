request.FILES returns empty dictionary despite setting enctype=“multipart/form-data”

I am trying to upload a csv file using Django but when I attempt to retrieve the file in my view, the request.FILES object is always an empty dictionary. I've followed various guides and ensured that the form is submitting a POST request and that the enctype="multipart/form-data" but I can't seem to figure out why it is always empty.
My form code is here:
<form action="{% url 'upload_lessons' %}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="form-horizontal">
{% csrf_token %}
<div class="form-group file-upload-form-input">
<div class="col-md-8">
<input type="file" name="csv_file" id="csv_file" required="True" class="form-control">
</div>
</div>
<div class="form-group file-upload-form-upload-button">
<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-12 col-md-offset-3" style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" formmethod="post" formaction="{% url 'upload_lessons' %}"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-upload" style="margin-right:5px;"></span>Upload </button>
</div>
</div>
</form>
My view code is here:
def upload_lessons(request):
if "GET" == request.method:
return redirect('get_scheduler')
try:
print(request.FILES)
print(request.body)
except Exception as e:
print(e)
return redirect('get_scheduler')
I am only testing out the file uploading process and I will be adding additional logic after I am able to read the csv file.
Not sure if this would be helpful, but when I print request.body, an example output is as follows:
b'csrfmiddlewaretoken=iELCfd6yPd4NZaXVSQrtBkkufxmq9FlKRtSTC9m5j0x71M5IjshmdE1eLPSnevVj&csv_file=classwithseats.csv'

Is there any JavaScript that you aren't showing? You don't need formmethod and formmethod since you have already set method and action on the form.
